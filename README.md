# JSONServerTest

This project aims to experiment with the json-server library, which is a quick and easy way to create a REST API server.


The main reason for this experiment is to speed up the workflow during future hackathons. Instead of spending valuable time to create and design API endpoints, I could create a simple json-server, which usually gets the job done and get the team to focus their attention on actual products.


All that is needed is a simple db.json file and the server can be started.
