# JSONServerTest

I created this project to experiment with the json-server library, which is a quick and easy way to create a REST API server.


The main reason for this experiment is to find ways to speed up the workflow during future hackathons. Instead of spending valuable time to create and design API endpoints, I could create a simple json-server, which gets the job done. I can then get the team to focus their attention on the actual product.


All that is needed is a simple db.json file and the server is ready to deploy.
